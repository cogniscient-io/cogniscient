# Adaptive Loop Simulation: Trace-Driven Proof of Adaptation

These simulations demonstrate a system architecture that **adapts its beliefs, 
policies, or goals in response to semantic contradiction**. It’s not a scripted 
logic tree, a rules engine, or a state machine. It’s a **self-revising epistemic runtime**—a Loop.

---

## Why This Exists

Traditional simulations treat contradiction as failure.  
This one treats it as **signal**—a prompt to revise the system’s internal model of the world.

> “This isn’t about success or failure.  
> It’s about whether the system *understands why* it’s wrong, and what it does next.”

## How It Works

1. **Scenario prompt defines a task domain**  
   (e.g. establish TCP connection, reroute robot, diagnose symptom cluster)

2. **Initial beliefs, policies, and expectations are generated**  
   These are latent, unobservable unless contradiction exposes them.

3. **Unexpected event or contradiction is introduced**  
   e.g. ACK not returned, obstacle detected where none was expected.

4. **The Loop activates epistemic scaffolding**  
   - Contradiction is detected  
   - Beliefs are questioned  
   - Mutation candidates are generated  
   - An escalation trace is formed  

5. **A semantic trace is logged**  
   This trace captures not just *what happened*, but *what was believed*, *why it changed*, and *what was considered*.

6. **The system revises itself**  
   Sometimes subtly (new hypothesis added). Sometimes drastically (goals reframed).

## 🧬 Why This Is a Proof of Adaptation

- The system doesn’t retry blindly—it adapts *based on why it thinks it failed*
- There’s no script or hard-coded fallback—the trace shows **emergent revision**
- Mutation candidates are contextually scoped, ranked, and justified
- Escalations can propagate across nested beliefs—not just surface heuristics
- The trace is *inspectable*, *repeatable*, and *explains itself*

> **If a system can revise its internal logic, log the rationale, and rerun in context—it’s adapting.**  
> This simulation proves that.

## 🔭 What to Look For

| Artifact                 | What It Shows                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 📝 Trace Log             | Semantic memory of mutation + rationale      |
| ⚠️ Contradiction Events | Where expectation and reality diverged       |
| 🔀 Mutation Scaffold     | Candidate changes to belief or policy space  |
| 🔁 Escalation Flow       | Propagation from local to global goals       |

## 🛣️ Next Steps

This simulation lays the groundwork for a real-world runtime. The trace model is narrative for now—but maps cleanly to:

- Symbolic mutation pipelines  
- Policy arbitration layers  
- Belief versioning infrastructure  
- Human oversight and regulatory auditing

You're not looking at a toy.  
You're looking at the **architecture of semantic resilience.**

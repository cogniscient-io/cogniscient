**Rethinking Control Systems by Revisiting Cybernetics and General Systems Theory**

This started as a simple idea: *Can I build a generic Control Plane?* Every control system I've worked on—or studied—has been a second-class citizen. It's the bespoke software written just to make a product work... and no more. Over time, these systems collapse under their own weight—bugs, feature additions, and the interactions between them spiral into complexity no team can realistically manage.

So I started over.

I reduced the problem to what I think are the first principles, and from that emerged a broader model—one grounded in **Cybernetics** (Wiener, 1948), **General Systems Theory** (Bertalanffy, 1968), and inspired by **cognitive models of adaptive intelligence** (Sternberg, 1997). From this came a control architecture following a three-state model:

- **Init** → System boot, environment setup  
- **Operate** → Optimized execution under predefined constraints  
- **Reconcile** → Exception handling, typically requiring external intervention—human input or code updates

This is **Cogniscient**.

We see this everywhere:
- Windows OS: fast in Run, static in failure (BSOD)  
- Industrial Control Systems: efficient but brittle under change  
- Robotics/IoT: struggle in unpredictable settings  
- Biological systems: autonomic (Operate) vs. learned behavior (Reconcile)

The insight? We've neglected **Reconcile**.

Most control systems treat exceptions as terminal conditions—log and halt. But what if **Reconcile** wasn’t an afterthought, but the *engine of adaptation*? Imagine a system where:

- Agents declare capabilities against ontologies  
- Response becomes recursive intelligence  
- Exception data fuels constraint refinement  
- Escalation triggers external guidance or meta-domain adaptation  
- fallback states restore stability under uncertainty

In this frame:
- *Operate* optimizes  
- *Reconcile* learns  
- *Init* aligns intent

And yes, it's recursive—but bounded. **Positive feedback**, long feared in control theory, becomes a *creative force*—shaped by ontologies, scoped by constraints, and mirrored across system levels.

**Survivability**, not just stability and robustness

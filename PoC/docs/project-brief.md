# Project Brief: Dynamic Control System with Runtime-Loaded Agents

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The Dynamic Control System is designed to provide a flexible and extensible control framework that can adapt to various domains by loading agents at runtime. This system will control whatever agents are loaded, based on their defined capabilities.

### 1.2 Goals
- Create a modular control system that can dynamically load and manage agents
- Enable agents to describe their own capabilities through a standardized interface
- Generate JSON configuration files from agent self-descriptions
- Support a wide range of applications through flexible agent architecture

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Runtime Agent Loading
- The control system will dynamically load agents at runtime
- Agents are defined by their capabilities in JSON configuration files
- The system will adapt its behavior based on loaded agents

### 2.2 Agent Self-Description
- Each agent will support a call to describe itself
- This self-description will include the agent's capabilities and configuration requirements
- The self-description can be used to generate the agent's JSON configuration file

### 2.3 JSON Configuration
- Agents will have JSON configuration files that describe their capabilities
- Configuration files will be used by the control system to understand and utilize agents
- The system will support automatic generation of configuration files from agent self-descriptions

## 3. Use Cases and Benefits

### 3.1 Potential Use Cases
- Industrial automation systems that need to adapt to different manufacturing processes
- Smart home systems that can integrate new devices without reprogramming
- Robotics platforms that can load different behavior modules for various tasks
- IoT management systems that can handle diverse connected devices

### 3.2 Benefits
- Flexibility to adapt to new domains without modifying the core control system
- Extensibility through simple addition of new agents
- Reduced development time for domain-specific applications
- Standardized interface for agent integration

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Core Requirements
- Runtime loading mechanism for agents
- Standardized JSON schema for agent configuration
- API for agent self-description
- Mechanism to generate JSON configs from self-descriptions

### 4.2 Constraints
- Agents must conform to a standardized interface for self-description
- JSON configuration files must follow a predefined schema
- The control system must validate agent configurations at load time
- Security considerations for runtime loading of agents

## 5. Success Metrics
- Successful loading and operation of at least 3 different types of agents
- Generation of valid JSON configuration files from agent self-descriptions
- Demonstration of system adaptability to a new domain with minimal changes
- Performance benchmarks showing acceptable overhead for runtime loading

## 6. Next Steps
1. Define the detailed architecture of the control system
2. Design the agent interface and JSON schema
3. Implement a prototype with basic agent loading capabilities
4. Develop sample agents to demonstrate the system's flexibility
5. Test the system with various agent configurations

# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Interactive CLI Interface for Cogniscient

## 1. Document Information

- **Product Name**: Cogniscient - Generic Control System Engine
- **Feature**: Interactive CLI Interface
- **PRD Version**: 1.1
- **Author**: Product Manager
- **Date**: October 1, 2025
- **Status**: Draft

## 2. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for transforming the Cogniscient CLI from a simple command execution interface to an interactive, conversational interface similar to Claude Code, Qwen Code, and Gemini CLI. The new interface will provide a REPL-style environment where users can dynamically interact with the system, perform multi-step tasks, and receive intelligent assistance through the LLM integration.

The interactive CLI will maintain all existing functionality while adding a conversational layer that makes it easier for users to explore capabilities, perform complex operations, and receive contextual help throughout their session.

## 3. Problem Statement

### 3.1 Current State
The current CLI in `cogniscient/cli.py` provides basic command-line execution with only three main commands:
- `run`: Initialize and run the Cogniscient system with agents
- `list-configs`: List all available configurations
- `load-config`: Load a specific configuration

### 3.2 Issues with Current Implementation
- Static, single-command execution model
- No conversational or iterative interaction
- Lacks the dynamic, exploratory nature of Claude Code/Qwen Code interfaces
- Users must know exact command syntax upfront
- No intelligent assistance or contextual help during operations
- Limited ability to perform multi-step workflows interactively

### 3.3 Comparison with Claude Code/Qwen Code Style
Claude Code and Qwen Code interfaces provide:
- Persistent interactive sessions
- Natural language understanding of user intents
- Multi-turn conversations for complex tasks
- Contextual awareness of session state
- Intelligent suggestions and auto-completion
- Ability to explore system capabilities dynamically

### 3.4 User Impact
- Users cannot explore capabilities interactively
- Complex multi-step operations require multiple command executions
- No natural language interface to the system
- Users may not realize the full potential of the system

## 4. Goals & Objectives

### 4.1 Primary Goals
- Transform CLI into an interactive, conversational interface
- Enable natural language interactions with the system
- Provide persistent session context
- Enable exploratory discovery of system capabilities
- Maintain all existing command-line functionality

### 4.2 Success Metrics
- Users spend more time in interactive sessions
- Users complete complex tasks with fewer individual commands
- Improved user satisfaction scores for CLI experience
- Natural language queries successfully map to system actions

## 5. User Stories

### 5.1 Primary Users
- **System Operators**: Developers and system administrators who manage Cogniscient deployments
- **Model Engineers**: Users who configure and optimize LLM-based systems
- **End Users**: Developers who interact with the Cogniscient system for various tasks

### 5.2 User Stories

1. **As a System Operator**, I want to start an interactive session with `cogniscient chat` so I can explore system capabilities through natural language.

2. **As a System Operator**, I want to ask "What configurations are available?" in the interactive session so I can discover and use different system configurations.

3. **As a Model Engineer**, I want to say "Run agent A with method B" in natural language so the system can execute the appropriate action.

4. **As an End User**, I want the system to remember my previous actions within the session so I can reference them in subsequent commands.

5. **As a System Operator**, I want the system to suggest possible next actions based on my current state so I can discover capabilities I didn't know existed.

6. **As a Model Engineer**, I want to ask "Why did the previous operation fail?" so the system can analyze its own logs and provide insights.

7. **As an End User**, I want to ask for help about specific capabilities in natural language so I can understand the system without reading documentation.

8. **As a System Operator**, I want to perform complex multi-step tasks within a single session without having to remember command syntax.
